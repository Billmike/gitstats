# GitStats
A simple PreactJS app that uses the GitHub search API to display repositories in a list.

## Running
`npm install` then `npm run start`

## Deploying
To deploy I run the build step and move the new js and css files to the docs folders which is the root GitHub pages folder. However please do not commit changes to the docs folders as I will do this manually.
